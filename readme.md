<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](readme%20source/game%20title.png)


Recently I've been dabbling in Godot for quite a bit, it's a very capable engine for 2D and I really like static language that's why I've chosen C# as my project language, there aren't a lot of quality C# Godot demo out there that's why I've inclined to make one to contribute back to Godot.

My main inspiration came from [this video by Alpha Beta Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TOGBZp8_Ao&list=WL&index=9&t=4s), I think it's very clever to combine multiple childhood retro games into one that's why I wanted to challenge myself to recreate the same game.

**You can do whatever you want with this project.**
 Most of the assets and audio is created by me, when it's not, it's under cc0 license (like [kenney explosion fx](https://kenney.nl/) and some sound effect from freesound.org)




### Built With ❤️ Using

* [Godot Mono](https://godotengine.org/)
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)
* [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/)


### Disclamer

I'm not affiliated with any of the companies above I just think that they're great and they provide really valuable tools for me that's why I wanted to give them credit

## Gameplay Demo

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started (Building & Exploring)

### Building

Just clone this repo and use [Godot Mono](https://godotengine.org/) to open the project folder "3 retro game in 1" and you'll be good to go. Check out their website if you don't how to setup mono environment
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LeeTeng2001/Pac-Pin-Pong.git
   ```

### Exploring
'3 retro game in 1/Scenes/World.tscn' is the main entrance for the game, you can see for example how player stats are stored, shader effects, ghost effects, timer example and more!

Happy exploring!
